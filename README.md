## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .facebook,
  .x,
  .instagram {
    min-width: 1rem;
    min-height: 1rem;
    border: 1px solid var(--Gray);
    border-radius: 100%;
    padding: 0.6rem;
  }
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```
